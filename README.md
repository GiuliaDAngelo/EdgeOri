## EdgeOrientation detection

This is only a first attempt for a simple edge orientation detector. 
The model relies on a bank of Gaussian Multivariates of different orientation to detect the edge orientation of cable plugins. 
The model cohmprend different scales for scale invariance. 

This specific system uis designed to the transferable to any neuromorphic platform for SNNs or sCNNs.
